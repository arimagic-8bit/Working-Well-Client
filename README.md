# Working Well

### Description

Working Well is a responsive web app created to help people stay focused on their tasks or activities. I used the [Pomodoro technique]([https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9cnica_Pomodoro](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/TÃ©cnica_Pomodoro)) as an example to create this app.

### How to use it?

You will have to open two terminals and follow each steps for each of them:

**Back-end**

```js
$ git clone https://github.com/arimagic-8bit/Working-Well.git
$ npm i

Create a .env file with this info:
- MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/working-well
- PORT=5000
- SECRET_SESSION=thebestapp (or whatever you want)
- PUBLIC_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000

$ npm run start:dev
```

**Front-end**

```javascript
$ git clone https://github.com/arimagic-8bit/Working-Well-Client.git
$ npm i

Create a .env file with this info:
- BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000

$ npm run start
```



### User stories

**Signup**: As an anon I can sign up in the platform so that I can start using the app.

**Login**: As a user I can login to the platform so that I can start using the app.

**Logout**: As a user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it.

**Set task/activity**: As a user I can create a task or activity I want to focus on and set my working and rest time.

### Backlog

- Add relaxing music when doing the task/activity.
- Add different time managing techniques that the user can choose. 
- Edit or remove activities 

## Client/Frontend

### React Router Routes

`<Route>` = allows anyone to see the page.

`<PublicRoute>` = allows unauthenticated users to see the page.

`<PrivateRoute>` = allows only authenticated users to see the page.
