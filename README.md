# Working Well

### Description

Working Well is a responsive web app created to help people stay focused on their tasks or activities. To manage the working and rest time I will use the [Pomodoro technique]([https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9cnica_Pomodoro](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/TÃ©cnica_Pomodoro)). 

### How to use it?

**Back-end**

```js
$ git clone https://github.com/arimagic-8bit/Working-Well.git
$ npm i
$ npm run start:dev
```

**Front-end**



### User stories

**Signup**: As an anon I can sign up in the platform so that I can start using the app.

**Login**: As a user I can login to the platform so that I can start using the app.

**Logout**: As a user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it.

**Set task/activity**: As a user I can create a task or activity I want to focus on and set my working and rest time.

**Edit activity**: As a user I can edit a task or activity before starting working on it

**Delete activity**: As a user I can delete an activity before starting working on it

### Backlog

- Add relaxing music when doing the task/activity.
- Add different time managing techniques that the user can choose. 

## Client/Frontend

### React Router Routes

`<Route>` = allows anyone to see the page.

`<PublicRoute>` = allows unauthenticated users to see the page.

`<PrivateRoute>` = allows only authenticated users to see the page.
